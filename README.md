### ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project

I'm currently working on a new web framework for Dart - [![logo](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/raw/main/apps/jaspr_pad/web/jaspr-32.png) jaspr](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr). 

It is designed to be SSR-first and has a Flutter-style component system, so that is has next to no 
learning curve for developers coming from Flutter ðŸ’ª.

- [Demo & Playground](https://jasprpad.schultek.de)
- [Docs](https://docs.page/schultek/jaspr)
 
It is still in the beta stage and I appreciate any help or feedback.
